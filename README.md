# Dylcogs
Just here making anime commands for [Red DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)

# Installation
```[p]cog repo add dylcogs https://github.com/AmIVoid/dylcogs```

```[p]cog install dylcogs [cog]```

Replace [p] with you bot's prefix. Replace [cog] with the name of the cog you want to install.

# Contact
Message me on discord ```*Void#0001``` about any issues or bugs.

# Credit
All credits go to [HarukiGrande](https://github.com/HarukiGrande) for providing gif cogs for me to base my work off.
Credits to both [HarukiGrande](https://github.com/HarukiGrande) again and [Quintenvw](https://github.com/Quintenvw) on their emote cogs that I expanded on.
